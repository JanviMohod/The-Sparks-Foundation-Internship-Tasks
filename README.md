# The Sparks Company internship (GRIP)

This repository is dedicated to the completion of all my tasks from *The Sparks Company Internship*. I will be updating the tasks I perform as a Data Science and Business Analytics intern at a singapore based company: The Sparks Limited.

Tools/IDE : Python/Jupyter Notebook

### Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML 
Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
This is supposed to be done with linear regression as we will be using just 2 variables. Data for this model can be found at : http://bit.ly/w-data.
What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
We need to predict the score of the student if he/she studies for 9.25 hrs/day.


### Task 2 - Prediction using Unsupervised ML
Predict the optimum number of clusters, from the given "iris" dataset and represent it visually.
I will be implementing this with the help of K-Means Clustering algorithm. Dataset for this model can be found at : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox.
What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
We need to predict the optimum number of clusters and it's visualization.


### Task 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
I will be doing this with the help of python libraries i.e. matplotlib and seaborn. Dataset can be found at : https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl.
What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
As a Business Analytics intern, I tried to find out the weak areas where we can work to make more profit. Also, tried to find out business problems can be derived by exploring the data.
